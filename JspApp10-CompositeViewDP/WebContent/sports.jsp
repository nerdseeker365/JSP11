 ate on Friday evening, MS Dhoni's fans were given a rude shock as Board of Control for Cricket in India's (BCCI) acting secretary Amitabh Chaudhary announced India's T20I squads for West Indies and Australia series.

MS Dhoni did not feature in either squads while Virat Kohli was given a rest for the three-T20I series against the West Indies. Rohit Sharma will lead India in Kohli's absence but the regular India captain will be back for T20Is vs Australia.
